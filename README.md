step1. ready global.mo
  - you can find it in gamefolder/bin/[version]/res/texts/[your language]/LC_MESSAGES/global.mo

  - I upload example of origin_global_mo.txt. but this is for korean and v13.1.0 game version
  - name_list.csv is example. you need to find ID in global_mo.txt

step3. overwrite new global_2.mo in gamefolder
